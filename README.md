# TimeApp

#### General info
My first ever project written from idea in my head to working program.
I know this is not the most beatiful code on Earth, but I've learned a lot during this project.
I've also met enormous number of bugs which I've managed to fix and I'm a little bit proud of it.

#### Description
This is simple application which includes 3 basic time-related functions:
- Timer
- Stopwatch
- Pomodoro Timer

#### Features
- Stopping and continuing countdown 
- Validation for user's input in Timer and Pomodoro Timer
- Resetting in any moment
- Current Pomodoro's cycle counter

#### How to run
Simply run any command-line interpreter and go into project's directory and type `py main.py`
